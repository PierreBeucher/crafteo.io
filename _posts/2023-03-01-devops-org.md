Bringing DevOps to your teams, organization and projects is no easy task. It requires **evangelization**, support from **business, management and teams** and an understanding of **DevOps culture, practices and technologies**. I can help you through this process:

- Help your organization and people understand the value of DevOps, working with C-level, managers, teams and individual contributors. 
- Organize your teams and projects go get the most out of DevOps, helping them communicate and collaborate through short feedback loops and continuous improvement.
- Define your DevOps **Architecture, Roadmap & Toolchain**, and follow through its implementation and various project management phases
