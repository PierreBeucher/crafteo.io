DevOps practices and methodologies are numerous. Knowing where to start, neither doing too much nor too little and implementing them the right way requires good counseling - without forgetting we're working with humans all along. A few well known DevOps practices I can help you with:

- **CI/CD** - Continuous Integration, Deployment & Delivery
- **Cloud-first** approach with **AWS** and **Kubernetes**
- **Kanban** project management and **Agile** workflows
- Software Development Lifecycle **Automation**
- **Security** without sacrificing efficiency
- **IaC** (Infrastructure as Code) & GitOps 
- **Observability**: Monitoring, Alerting & Logging
- Continuous Feedback and **short feedback loops**
- Developer Experience and **human-first approach**
